# Data-Types
**Aim**:  To study and implement C++ program structure(Data Types) 

**Theory**: This program demonstrates basic input and output operations in C++ by handling various data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings. It uses cin to read user inputs and cout to display outputs. The program captures an integer, a floating-point number, and a character, then reads and displays the user's name, showing basic string manipulation with the size() function.

**Output**:
